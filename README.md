# CPD Goal Tracker Application

This repository houses a full-stack application for tracking CPD (Continuous Professional Development) goals. It includes a client-side React application and a server-side Node.js API. The Node.js API uses MongoDB for data storage and provides endpoints for managing goals and their associated activities. The React application provides a user interface for creating and managing these goals and activities.

The repository structure is as follows:

```
- root
  - client
  - server
```


## Client Application

The client application, located in the `client` folder, is a React application built using TypeScript. It provides an intuitive user interface for users to interact with the CPD goals. It communicates with the server-side API for performing CRUD operations on the goals and associated activities.

For more detailed information about the client-side application, refer to the README.md file in the `client` folder.

## Server Application

The server application, located in the `server` folder, is a Node.js API. It provides endpoints for managing CPD goals and their associated activities. The API uses MongoDB for data storage, and includes authentication and logging features.

For more detailed information about the server-side application, refer to the README.md file in the `server` folder.
